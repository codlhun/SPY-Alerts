    <!-- Content Section: Tinnitus -->
    <section id="tinnitus">
        <h2>Tinnitus</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Tinnitus:</strong> Tinnitus is a ringing or buzzing sound in the ears without an external sound source. It is commonly caused by prolonged exposure to loud noise, especially during military service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>38CFR Guidance:</strong> Veterans can file for tinnitus as a disability claim under VA law. Compensation for tinnitus is typically rated at 10% under the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/section-4.87#p-4.87.6260" target="_blank">38 CFR §4.87 (Diagnostic Code 6260)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> Whether you're newly separated, filing an initial claim, or submitting a supplemental claim, ensure you provide clear documentation of your condition. For appeals, you may need to show how your condition has worsened over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Documentation Needed:</strong> Veterans should provide medical evidence of tinnitus, hearing tests, and any service records detailing exposure to acoustic trauma during military service.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section: Limitation of Flexion (Knee) -->
    <section id="limitation-of-flexion-knee">
        <h2>Limitation of Flexion (Knee)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Limitation of Flexion (Knee):</strong> This refers to the reduced ability to bend the knee, often due to injuries or wear and tear from military service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>38CFR Guidance:</strong> Under the VA disability rating, limitation of knee flexion is covered under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/section-4.71a#p-4.71a.5260" target="_blank">Diagnostic Code 5260 in 38 CFR §4.71a</a>. The rating is based on the degree of motion limitation, ranging from 0% to 30%.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> For newly separated veterans, providing recent medical assessments is key. For those filing appeals or supplemental claims, show how your knee's range of motion has worsened, and include any new medical reports that reflect the current severity of the condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Documentation Needed:</strong> Medical records showing the range of knee movement and details of the injury or condition that led to the impairment are required.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section: Hearing Loss -->
    <section id="hearing-loss">
        <h2>Hearing Loss</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Hearing Loss:</strong> Many veterans experience hearing loss due to exposure to loud noises such as gunfire, aircraft engines, or explosions during military service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>38CFR Guidance:</strong> Hearing loss claims are rated under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/section-4.85#p-4.85.6100" target="_blank">Diagnostic Code 6100, 38 CFR §4.85</a>. Compensation depends on the level of hearing impairment determined by audiometric testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> Newly separated veterans should have an audiology test performed as soon as possible. For appeals, provide evidence that shows your hearing has worsened since your last claim. For supplemental claims, document any new medical conditions contributing to further hearing loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Documentation Needed:</strong> Veterans should submit audiology test results and any service records showing noise exposure. Medical nexus opinions linking the hearing loss to military service may be helpful.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) -->
    <section id="ptsd">
        <h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>PTSD:</strong> PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event during military service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>38CFR Guidance:</strong> PTSD is rated under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/section-4.130#p-4.130.9411" target="_blank">Diagnostic Code 9411 in 38 CFR §4.130</a>. The rating scale ranges from 0% to 100% based on the severity of symptoms and their impact on daily functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> If you're newly separated, gather documentation that links your PTSD to specific events in service. For appeals, show how your condition has worsened since the initial claim. Supplemental claims should include new medical diagnoses or treatments to justify an increase in your rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Documentation Needed:</strong> Medical diagnosis of PTSD, evidence of a service-related traumatic event, and documentation of symptoms that affect daily life are essential for a PTSD claim.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section: Lumbosacral or Cervical Strain -->
    <section id="lumbosacral-cervical-strain">
        <h2>Lumbosacral or Cervical Strain</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Lumbosacral or Cervical Strain:</strong> This refers to back or neck strains commonly resulting from physical demands of military service, including heavy lifting or injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>38CFR Guidance:</strong> Disabilities involving lumbosacral or cervical strain are covered under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/section-4.71a#p-4.71a.5237" target="_blank">Diagnostic Code 5237 in 38 CFR §4.71a</a>. The rating is determined based on the limitation of motion and the severity of pain and functional loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> For new claims, provide recent X-rays or MRI results. If appealing a prior decision, show how the condition has limited your movement or worsened in pain. For supplemental claims, highlight any new medical diagnoses or changes in your range of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Documentation Needed:</strong> Medical records documenting the injury, range of motion tests, and any history of in-service injuries are important.
