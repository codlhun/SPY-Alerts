        <h1>Adding Secondary Diagnoses to Strengthen Your Appeal</h1>
        <p>When filing an appeal, adding secondary diagnoses that are linked to your primary conditions can help strengthen your case. Below are the five most common primary conditions and their related secondary diagnoses, which can be added to your claim.</p>

        <!-- Secondary Diagnoses for Tinnitus -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tinnitus</h2>
            <p>Tinnitus is often rated at 10% but can be linked to other conditions to enhance your appeal. Consider these secondary diagnoses:</p>
            <div class="break"></div>
            <p><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Many veterans with tinnitus experience anxiety as a secondary condition, which can be claimed alongside the primary condition.</p>
            <p><strong>Depression:</strong> Mental health conditions such as depression may arise due to long-term hearing problems caused by tinnitus.</p>
            <p><strong>Sleep Disorders:</strong> Veterans may struggle with sleep due to constant ringing in the ears, which can be claimed as a secondary diagnosis.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Secondary Diagnoses for Limitation of Flexion (Knee) -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Limitation of Flexion (Knee)</h2>
            <p>Veterans with knee injuries may experience the following secondary conditions:</p>
            <div class="break"></div>
            <p><strong>Hip Pain:</strong> Chronic knee issues can lead to overcompensation in the hip, resulting in pain or dysfunction.</p>
            <p><strong>Lower Back Pain:</strong> Knee injuries can contribute to imbalances that lead to chronic lower back pain.</p>
            <p><strong>Depression:</strong> Limited mobility can result in depression due to a reduced quality of life.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Secondary Diagnoses for Hearing Loss -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hearing Loss</h2>
            <p>Veterans experiencing hearing loss can also file for these related conditions:</p>
            <div class="break"></div>
            <p><strong>Balance Issues (Vertigo):</strong> Hearing loss, particularly inner ear damage, can cause balance problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Tinnitus:</strong> Often, hearing loss and tinnitus go hand in hand. If not initially claimed together, tinnitus can be added as a secondary condition.</p>
            <p><strong>Depression:</strong> Hearing loss may lead to social isolation and contribute to depression.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Secondary Diagnoses for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
            <p>PTSD is often linked to the following secondary diagnoses:</p>
            <div class="break"></div>
            <p><strong>Substance Abuse:</strong> Veterans with PTSD may develop substance abuse issues as a coping mechanism.</p>
            <p><strong>Sleep Apnea:</strong> There is increasing recognition that PTSD may contribute to or exacerbate sleep apnea.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiety/Depression:</strong> Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression are often secondary to PTSD.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Secondary Diagnoses for Lumbosacral or Cervical Strain -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Lumbosacral or Cervical Strain</h2>
            <p>Back and neck strains often lead to the following secondary conditions:</p>
            <div class="break"></div>
            <p><strong>Sciatica:</strong> Lower back issues may lead to sciatica, a condition where nerve pain radiates down the leg.</p>
            <p><strong>Radiculopathy:</strong> Nerve root compression from spinal strain may result in radiculopathy, causing pain and weakness in the arms or legs.</p>
            <p><strong>Depression:</strong> Chronic pain from these conditions often results in depression.</p>
